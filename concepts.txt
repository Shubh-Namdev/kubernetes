What is Kubernetes ?
Kubernetes is a tool which helps us to manage multiple applications efficiently. 
It takes care of our applications's -
   Scalability
   Availability
   Load Balancing
   Container Orchestration
   Rollouts and Rollbacks

Architecture 
   Consists of Master and Cluster
   Clust has multiple woker nodes
   Worker node is a containerized applications or server

   Master/Control Plane(single)
    API Server      - Manages worker nodes using APIs 
    Schedular       - Register new worker nodes
    ETCD            - Takes care of all the data related to worker nodes 
    Control Manager - Keeps control of resources and check if everything is working fine
 
   Worker Nodes(multiple)
    kubectl           - it helps in communication with Master/control plane/k8s
    pod               - it keeps container or multiple container and manges the resources
    kube proxy        - takes care of newtworks as each worker node has to connect externally/internally
    container runtime - helps to run the worker node

Concepts Before Start
    kubectl     - it helps in communication with Master/control plane/k8s
    kubermini   - a miniature version of k8s structure using which we can learn k8s
    config      - configurations of the applications(service urls etc)
    secrets     - env variable(db pass, port etc)
    deployment  - deploy the application in pod(a wrapper through which master will connect to this)
    service     - service will make sure that this node is available for internal network
